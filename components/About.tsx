          ðŸ’¡ I'm Quentin. Here is a little bit about me... I've always been
          passionate about computers and have been surrounded by technology all
          my life. I come from a networking background and decided to start
          learning to code since 2017 due to the repetitive task that network
          can bring down the line. I always liked building stuff - from DIY to
          Web App. I have been working for the same company for over 15 years,
          from Network Engineer to Project Manager and now holding the position
          of Vice President Operations EMEA & APAC. I'm managing an
          international team. I have a wide variety of skills from networking to
          project management to DevOps (K8s / Cloud Architecture / Linux). I
          like working under pressure & meeting deadlines. I'm a self sufficient
          person, decision maker eager to learn new things.
          <br />
          <br />
          All this brought me to learn WebDev and specialise in FrontEnd.
